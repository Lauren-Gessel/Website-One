    <div>Weeklys List</div>
    <h1>Weekly A</h1>
    <p>  This was the first week of class meaning that most of the things that we learned were things just to
         get us started in learning html and CSS so that we can move on to more complicated procedures to make 
         well formulated websites. We learned how to make text appear like using a p in brackets and how to 
         change the appearance of that text to make it bigger or italicized with i in brackets. We also started going into
         how to create links to other html pages through buttons that are connected to separate web pages. We 
         learned how to insert images and frame them in the browser so that they look correct and fit the page 
         well no matter the browser size by changing the parameters that we allow the image to take up in the 
         screen to percentages. We also discussed some basics on css and how to assign text like paragraphs a 
         certain color to appear as. Although I am still confused by it at times because the only line of code 
         that I understand to change color, changes all of the items. For example, if I assigned “paragraphs” 
         to be blue they would all be blue instead of having control of specific ones. I found difficulty when 
         it came to linking buttons to a new web browser as it was a lot to remember and certain positioning of
         lines of code that could easily be misplaced, to link a file the path has to lead through the files in 
         the computer directly from where you want it and as someone who struggles with keeping things organized 
         I know that will probably be annoying later for me as well when my files start getting cluttered.
    </p>
    <h1>Weekly B</h1>
    <p>This week we went over how to set boxes and how to set them to fit within space differently. Which requires
         mostly work in <i>CSS</i> to set dimensions and states for the box to exist as. We also learned when divs 
         and spans are used. <b>Boxes and setting up borders</b> were very overwhelming for me to all take in. I 
         know it will be something that I need to come back to and will be continuously working on to get better
          at. They follow a lot of rules, yet to human eyes who are new to it, the rules and their orders can be 
          very confusing to fix when an issue comes up. Some examples of the style position that borders can follow 
          are static, relative, fixed, absolute, and sticky all with their own abilities. Static is as basic as 
          you can go as it just goes with the form of the page unchanged. Relative is <i>“relative”</i> to the page 
          where it moves with its size. Fixed always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. Absolute 
          always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled. Position sticky is positioned based on the 
          user's scroll position. All of these different positions and their uses come in handy for different times 
          and I understand that it'll be nice to have some memory of when they will be needed.</p>
    <h1>Weekly C</h1>
    <p>During this week of class we learned some more functionality and more details in complexities of CSS and what is 
        possible to be accomplished through it. We also explored and showed our capablities of what we can do with collected information
        in the form of two excersizes that challenged us to explore and attempt to make intrest in poems and a tags. </p>
    <h1>Weekly D</h1>
    <p>This week there was a focus on our first project whcih involved making a website to house all of our information
         and future weeklys. I decided to go with a theme that revolves around thematic trends of the 90s and trying to
        relate it back to that time woth the themes as well as bringing that styling into more futuristic html 
        techniques while still keeping the colors and patterns of the 90s. I started my website and have run into some
         problems just in lack of skill to measure up to where I want the website to be quality and ability wise. I 
         would like to create a sticky box in the corner that has a pixel bob ross who has various lines of 
        encouragement that it cycles through while you are on the page. I also want to keep the page organized and am
        finding it difficult to get all of the moving parts to piece together in the perfect way. during our first 
        session of working with our website design, I mostly tried to get down the different elements of the page, 
        links to other sections and how the different boxes fill out the pages consistently. I am still in the process 
        of fully fleshing out the boxes especially the sticky one that bob ross will be in, which has proven to be very 
        finicky.</p>
    <h1>Weekly E</h1>
    <p>This week was the week that we turned in and reviewed our websites along with starting to learn JavaScript 
        functions through P5.js. My website was a tough challenge to make something I was content with and included 
        a lot of tweaking and scrapping of work due to functionality and aesthetics. In the end I was proud of what 
        I was able to create and believe it has a lot of room for growth and adaptation as well. But I do feel satisfied
         with it as of now but hope to be able to add some more interactive elements like what I can do with the 
         Bob Ross head that directs you as well as some more pages to explore as a whole. I really like my pixel 
         art included in it and I find it to represent what I wanted very well. I hope to also add more definition
          into the garden page so that it has more interactive elements and may align with the weather outside as it changes.
        I have had some prior experience with JavaScript and p5.js and find myself refreshing my memory on its rules 
        and functions and am very excited to have it work in unison with my html and css work. I do not know a lot
         about javascript despite previous classes, so I am looking to push myself with it and create something that 
         uses things I have not previously learned about. 
        </p>
    <h1>Weekly F</h1>
    <p>
 This week was full of javascript and learning how to do simple animation like coding through it. We worked on excercise 4 in drawing
    with code! I started with drawing a small picture of a dinosaur and planned to have a comet come in from the backrgound and explode 
    upon reaching the ground near the dinosaur. It took a lot of working out to figure out the correct way to achieve the effects that I wanted
    in that I would have a growing circle that moves diagonally from the top right corner to the center of the bottom of the canvas. 
    It was difficult at first, because it was my first time, on how to figure out how to work out variables and how to get them to change and adjust
    as the animation continues. I did a lot of adjusting with variable values and how where I put them and what I adjust change the effects
    for a while I struggled to find how to create that diagonal movement but eventually I found the right sequence of math and movement. I also
    wanted to create a small explosion at the end and ended up creating an if statement that played after the comet reached a certain position
    so that it looked like it happens on impact. In this if statement I have a random circle be placed over and over to create a chaotic 
    screen of colorful circles. I also introduced a set of words that would be chosen at random to appear with the explosion so that there 
    would be a central focus to the ending. It was a lot of just working out the formats and tools but I feel very acomplished and like I have
    a better understanding of the content!
    </p>
    <h1>Weekly G</h1>
    <p>
        Durring class this week, we discussed more in detail on Javascript and complex commands and functions that can be utilized in it.
        We discussed the random functions that offer some chance into the output of an event and we discussed how functions work and can be used
        to make actions simpler. The next project coming up is one where we make a shape and create a function that varies some characteristics of that shape
        so that a canvas with a lot of these shapes can be new and interesting with every refresh. For mine I am thinking about doing a variation in mug shapes or 
        eveyn in types and colors of candies that would show up on the screen. For the mugs I would varry the height and width of the mugs as well as the color, positioning,
        and maybe even the contents in the cup. I also plan to feature steam waves above the cups and may vary how those appear aswell. I am still figuring out how
        to successfully use the functions and continue to get a bit tripped up on the formation and howw the variables work within it.
        I hope to continue to working out my understanding of those principles so that I can successfully use them in this excersize.
    </p>
    <h1> Weekly K</h1>
    <p>This week was the week where we finished all of our work up for the final project, for mine I did a lot of work and troubleshooting to get
        a working paintable canvas to be attached to this website, its not perfect but in the state that it is in, it took a lot already and is functional enough.
        I also worked on making additions to other pages on the website like the gallery having an extra animation when the images are hovered over that gives a deeper explaination
    of the work presented. As well as improving my way of formating the work as the "pre" would not have held up as well as my nesting dolls of div tags.
    I also implemented my mug random animation so that it is another path for users to explore and play around with. I added a small room as a background and text to let the user]
    know how to get it to do something of intrest. I am happy with the work I put into improving the website and feel like the improvements and additions make the website more interesting to 
see and explore as well as keep users engaged with the many silly routes for longer.   </p>
